            Our comprehensive data analysis platform helps us determine which
            tree species are viable in your local climate zone. We use satellite
            data and Lidar to calculate ideal planting density and potential
            yield for your individual plot of land. We leverage the latest
            precision agriculture techniques to ensure a healthy, productive
            orchard, maximizing availability and quality of fresh fruit in your
            area. After planting, we monitor your tree health and adjust growing
            plans to keep your orchard happy.
